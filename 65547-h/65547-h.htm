much like the one that is part of the museum. After high school
his mother&rsquo;s plans for business college for her son were interrupted by
a job selling for the Jewel Tea Company, and other sales ventures. In
1923 he and a friend drove a Ford like the one to be seen in the Ford
Garage from Minnesota to California taking odd jobs along the way to
finance the trip.</p>
<p>In California he met and married Vivian Petersen who had traveled
to California with her three sisters. The three Geisler children were
born in Pasadena where &ldquo;Dick&rdquo; was operating the feed, hardware and
appliance business he started in the height of the depression. In 1942
Mr. Geisler traded his California home for a farm near Blunt, South
Dakota, sold the businesses and returned to the Midwest.</p>
<p>Crops had been nonexistent for some years prior to his move to
South Dakota and the natives were amused at the West coast city dude
who busily went about planting wheat. The Geisler touch and ideal
conditions brought about the first of many banner years for crops in
the area.</p>
<p>In 1945 &ldquo;Dick&rdquo; bought a John Deere Chevrolet dealership in Murdo
and moved his family once again. In 1950 he opened the Phillips 66
gas station at the junction of U.S. 16 and 83. The embryo of the
PIONEER AUTO MUSEUM took shape in the form of an old buggy
and a 1913 Ford Peddler&rsquo;s Wagon (now located in the Ford Garage)
which were parked in front of the station and elicited considerable comment
from tourists. As the years rolled by a vintage car here and an
antique there were added to &ldquo;Dick&rsquo;s&rdquo; small but growing collection.
Dick&rsquo;s son, John, made the first trip to pick up a car back east. Upon
returning, John told his father about other cars to be had. By ones and
twos the collection grew to where something had to be done to properly
store and show the cars.</p>

<p>ANTIQUE CARS</p>
<p>Wide variances of opinion exist as to what constitutes an antique car. To those
unknowledgeable in history of the automobile it is often merely a relative description
of an old car. The Veteran Motor Car Club of America classifies any car over
35 years old as antique. The Antique Automobile Club of America considers all
pre-1930 models qualifying as antiques. The Horseless Carriage Club limit their
choices for antique designation to pre-1916 cars. As we said, the term is somewhat
relative.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><span class="sc">The Vintage Years</span></span></h2>
<p>Following World War I cars that had remained drawing board dreams sprung
into reality. Faster production methods had evolved from the war and were now
applied to the auto industry. New techniques for making lighter alloys were
brought into use and new advances in the theory of the internal combustion engine
were tested and applied. The result was a selection of autos superior to those
of the previous period.</p>
<p>Production had passed from experiment to refinement. Efficiency was the
byword with great care given in the construction of each unit during that post-war
period. Mass production sounded the death knell for the short-lived Vintage Years
which, it is generally agreed, lasted from 1919 to 1930.</p>

<p>What does set apart a true classic from a standard production car? Two things in
principle: Brilliant and unusual design coupled with the most advanced engineering
of the day. Almost inseparable from these attributes are two more basic factors:
Superlative hand workmanship and limited production. Some classics may excel in
body design coupled to a lesser standard of engineering or vice versa, but all the

soon to be recognized as the most important single factor in feeding a rapidly growing

<p class="tb">The PIONEER AUTO MUSEUM opened in May of 1954 with
25 cars and a single building. As time went on a collection of old farm
machinery and tractors blossomed in back. And as old original buildings
such as jails, schools, churches, banks and many others were
doomed to replacement in the community, Mr. Geisler added yet another
facet of olden day preservation to the museum. China, toys, glassware,
lamps, musical antiquities and other things too numerous to mention
here were added. So many things, in fact, that many buildings such
as the general store, the church, and the school house are fully stocked
and equipped with authentic original trappings. Today the museum
boasts 25 buildings with over 200 vehicles plus thousands of other
memorabilia. Because of Mr. Geisler&rsquo;s fondness for Ford automobiles,
a special building in the museum, Henry&rsquo;s Ford Garage, contains only
Fords. In 1956 Mr. Geisler sold the Chevrolet-John Deere Agency and
purchased the Ford Agency in Murdo, which is managed by another
son, Dave.</p>
<p>PIONEER AUTO MUSEUM is more than a mere tourist attraction.
It is a tribute to a man and woman and their family who have
had the foresight to preserve the past. The thousands of items to be
seen in a fine state of preservation would have doubtless been lost to
the dumps and junk piles. Instead posterity can visit and maybe &ldquo;live
a little&rdquo; in the days of their forefathers in authentic surroundings.</p>
<p>Visit with Dick and John. They will be happy to give you interesting
and expert information on anything in the PIONEER AUTO
MUSEUM. They might even relate a few of the interesting and amusing
tales of how the cars were found and moved from over 40 states to
the PIONEER AUTO MUSEUM in Murdo, South Dakota.</p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
